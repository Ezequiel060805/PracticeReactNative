## üöÄ About This Repository

Each folder in this repository contains a **standalone Expo project** focused on a specific topic ‚Äî from audio playback to health tracking, chart visualizations, and multi-screen navigation.  
These projects are intentionally lightweight but functional, showing my ability to integrate APIs, manage state, and deliver clean UI/UX.
